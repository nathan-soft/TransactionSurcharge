The logic of the app needs to change. We start by introducing an "E-Wallet Feature" if there's none already. After the expected "bank charge" must have been subtracted from the "Amount to be transferred" to get the "Advised Transfer Amount", the app performs a check to see if the addition of "Advised Transfer Amount" and "Actual Bank Charge" equals "Amount to be transferred". If it doesn't, the app lets the value of the "Amount to be transferred" to be used in place of "Advised Transfer Amount" and does a refund by crediting the e-wallet with the "Actual Bank Charge".
